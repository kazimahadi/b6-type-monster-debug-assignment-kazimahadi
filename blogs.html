        <h1>Q1: difference between local storage and session storage?</h1>
        <p>sessionStorage is similar to localStorage ; the difference is that while data in localStorage doesn't expire,
            data in sessionStorage is cleared when the page session ends. Whenever a document is loaded in a particular
            tab in the browser, a unique page session gets created and assigned to that particular tab.</p>

        <h1>Q2: difference between global scope and block scope?</h1>
        <P>In a browser environment, the global scope is controlled by the window object while in Node. js, it's
            controlled by the global object. Block scopes are what you get when you use if statements, for statements,
            and the like.</P>

        <h1>Q3: how to work js event loop?</h1>
        <p>The Event Loop has one simple job â€” to monitor the Call Stack and the Callback Queue. If the Call Stack is
            empty, the Event Loop will take the first event from the queue and will push it to the Call Stack, which
            effectively runs it. Such an iteration is called a tick in the Event Loop.</p>

        <h1>Q4: How do I get undefined in JavaScript?</h1>
        <p>You will get undefined value when you call a non-existent property or method of an object. In the above
            example, a function Sum does not return any result but still we try to assign its resulted value to a
            variable. So in this case, result will be undefined.</p>
